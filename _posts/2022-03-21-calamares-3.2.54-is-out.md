 - During the installation ("exec") step, while the slideshow is displayed,
   there is also a button to show the scrolling installation log as it
   is written. (Thanks Bob)

## Modules ##
 - *fstab* module correctly handles empty UUID strings. (Thanks Evan)
 - *partition* module no longer forgets configured partition-layouts.
   It also respects configured partition labels better. (Thanks Santosh)
