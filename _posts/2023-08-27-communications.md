Calamares, like many Free Software projects, has been
using a mix of Matrix and IRC for some years, with
a gentle preference shift towards Matrix in 2023.
Bridging was a great solution, when it worked.
It is time to admit that we're not watching IRC
(at all) when it is not bridged, and that Matrix is where
real-time chat happens.

For communications that **can wait**, like bug reports, issues,
feature requests, the best place remains [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues).
This is where long-term discussions go, and where we can properly
keep track of whether they are fixed or not. Issues are not a help-channel:
that's what Matrix is for.

For **real time** communication, chit-chat, discussing whether something
is worth filing an issue for, notifications, and little things
(typo's, website stuff) there visit Matrix:

- [Matrix via :kde.org](https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/%23calamares:kde.org) (link is to Element on KDE.org)

Matrix is persistent, so you will need to register **somewhere** on
the Matrix federation. A KDE account is ok (`@someone:kde.org`), or a 
global Matrix account is ok (`@someone:matrix.org`) or any other home-server
will do as well.
