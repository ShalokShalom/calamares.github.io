[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is now in its eighth year.
The Calamares project has participated [before](/calamares-hacktoberfest/)
and we've seen some small benefits from it. This year, the rules have
tightened to be stricter on spam pull-requests (in 2020 we got a couple),
and I'm glad of that. Potential contributors can check out the
[list of good starter-issues](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ahacktoberfest).
Most of those issues have a checklist to help new folks along.
The checklist should take you from "get Calamares to run at all" through to "submit a PR that can be merged".
