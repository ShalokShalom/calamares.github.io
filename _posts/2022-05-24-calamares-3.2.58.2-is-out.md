This is a extra-quick release for an issue that shows up when using a
swap **file** on a btrfs filesystem; the installation would fail with
a Python error, raised from btrfs-progs. Reported by Evan James, Erik
Dubois, TechXero. The problem was exposed by new versions of btrfs-progs,
so this release may not be needed for your distro, depending on
kernel- and btrfs-progs-versions.
