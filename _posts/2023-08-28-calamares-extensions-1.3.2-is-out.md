title: "Calamares Extensions 1.3.2"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

There is a new irregular release of Calamares Extensions.
[Calamares Extensions](https://github.com/calamares/calamares-extensions)
are additional modules for Calamares that do not fit in the "core"
Calamares release -- extra-specialised modules, OS-specific modules,
and modules for unique situations. Most recent work has been on
the *mobile* module.

<!--more-->

We skipped a couple of releases in the release-notes, then tagged
1.3.1 without a version bump or release-notes. So 1.3.2 brings us
back to "regular releases".

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Anke Boersma
 - Nathan Schulte
 - Oliver Smith
 - stravanpannala
 - undef

Changes and new modules in this release:
 - *mobile* Has new configuration options. (Thanks Nathan, Oliver)
 - *unpackfsc* Uses a more portable invocation of tar. (Thanks sravanpannala)
