This is a translations-only release, closing off the 3.2 branch.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Adriaan de Groot

The only changes in this release are translation updates, which
have come from Transifex via the new(ish) cli tool. There's a fair
bit of churn because of HTML-encoding.

This is the last translation update of the 3.2 series, and the
3.3 strings will now be the source-files for translation.
