I -- Adriaan de Groot -- have been running the Calamares project for five years now,
sponsored by Blue Systems. Blue Systems has supported the Calamares
project since early days and through two maintainers now (Teo and myself).
After these five years,
I have decided to hand in my badge and move on to different things.
This means that I'm no longer paid to spend three days a week on Calamares and
my involvement is going to be dialed back to incidental-volunteer-contributor,
although I'll have maintainer-powers (just like Teo still does) to keep
things moving in the interim.

The communities that use Calamares
and contribute to it -- EndeavourOS, Manjaro, Debian, KaOS
and dozens of others -- need to sort things out for themselves a
little bit. It's always been an open project, and it will continue
like that. Hopefully we can welcome a new maintainer later this year.
