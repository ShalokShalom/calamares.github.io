This is a **hotfix** release, that addresses a regression introduced
by "harmless" fixes for compiler warnings. The "fix" introduced
an integer overflow in the partition module, leading to a negative-size
swap partition. Reported by EndeavourOS (Joe Kamprad) and Xero Linux.

Distributions are **specifically** reminded to update the *umount* module
configuration (and to use *preservefiles* if needed).
