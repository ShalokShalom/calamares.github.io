title: "Calamares 3.2.56 released"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

This is a regular short-cycle release.
There are a handful of bugfixes.
**Note** that Calamares 3.2 development is winding down,
and work is moving to the 3.3 series. This means that Calamares
3.2 branch will soon change to "bugfix-only" mode with infrequent
release, and 3.3 will get the regular updates.
Stay tuned for a more detailed roadmap.

## Core ##
 - Changes in git forced some changes on the CI tooling.

## Modules ##
 - *locale* showed the wrong timezone for Dhaka, although it configured
   the correct one. #1929
 - *users* module sets global storage key *fullname* to the full name
   of the user (e.g. what is entered in the "your full name" box on the
   users page). #1923 (Thanks Victor)
