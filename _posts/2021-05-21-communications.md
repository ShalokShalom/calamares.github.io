title: "Communications Channels"

Calamares, like many Free Software projects, has been
using IRC -- and the Freenode network -- for many years
for real-time communication, for idle chit-chat and 
for community-building. Recent upheaval at Freenode
has encouraged the Calamares team to diversify the communication
channels.

For communications that **can wait**, like bug reports, issues,
feature requests, the best place remains [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues).
This is where long-term discussions go, and where we can properly
keep track of whether they are fixed or not.

For **real time** communication, chit-chat, discussing whether something
is worth filing an issue for, notifications, and little things
(typo's, website stuff) there are **three** places, which are
monitored with varying intensity by the Calamares team:

- [Matrix via :kde.org](https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/%23calamares:kde.org) (link is to Element on KDE.org)
- [IRC on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?randomnick=1&channels=%23calamares) (link is to Kiwi IRC on Freenode)
- [IRC on Libera.chat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.libera.chat/#calamares) (link is to Kiwi IRC connecting to Libera.chat)

IRC is not persistent, so don't ask-and-leave in the channel because you
will never get an answer. It does not require registration, though.
Matrix **is** persistent, but you will need to register **somewhere** on
the Matrix federation. A KDE account is ok (`@someone:kde.org`), or a 
global Matrix account is ok (`@someone:matrix.org`) or any other home-server
will do as well.

Matrix is preferred. It has persistence, rich text, and better notifications.
