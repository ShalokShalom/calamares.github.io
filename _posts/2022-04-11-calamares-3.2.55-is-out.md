This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - vtriolet (new contributor! Welcome!)

## Core ##
 - `readTargetFile()` did not properly return all the lines of the target
   file. #1918 (thanks vtriolet)

## Modules ##
 - *users* module has rearranged configuration for setting the hostname.
   Legacy settings are preserved, but produce a warning. Please see
   `users.conf` for details.
 - *users* module has a new hostname.location setting, *Transient*, which
   will force the installed system to transient-hostname-setting by removing
   the file `/etc/hostname`.
 - *users* module has a new hostname.template setting, which allows some
   tweaking of how the hostname suggestion is constructed. In particular,
   it can be configured to use the current hostname (whatever that may be).
   See the example `users.conf` for details on available keys.
