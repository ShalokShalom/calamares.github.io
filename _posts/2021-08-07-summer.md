Calamares development will be somewhat slow in the month of
August: vacation and other meetings mean that there are
**no** short-cycle releases expected until early September.
Development will pick up as usual at the end of August.
In the meantime, things are in the capable hands of
Calamares-using distributions like KaOS, Manjaro, and ArcoLinux.
