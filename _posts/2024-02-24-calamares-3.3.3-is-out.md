excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

This release is primarily to fix a runtime error that shows
up in particular build configurations. With KDE Plasma 6 megarelease
imminent, some KDE Plasma-related modules have been ported.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Adriaan de Groot
 - Anke Boersma

Translations have been updated (3.3.2 skipped that step).

## Core ##
 - Core libraries *libcalamares* and *libcalamaresui* now build with
   hidden visibility by default, as a step towards ABI stability.
 - A runtime crash caused by (mis?)use of Qt UniqueConnection which
   shows up in Debug builds was resolved.

## Modules ##
 - *interactiveterminal* can use konsole in Qt6 too. (thanks Anke)
 - *plasmalnf* module ported to Plasma 6. (thanks Anke)
 - *welcomeq* example extended to include Markdown syntax. (thanks Anke)
