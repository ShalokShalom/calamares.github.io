This is a teeny-tiny release (that's why it is numbered like a hotfix).
It does fix a recent regression in the *partition* module, where
a pop-up message asks you to create a gargantuan EFI partition.
The message is supposed to say "300 MiB", but expresses 300 MiB in bytes,
so it's off by a factor of a million (more, even).

There was some refactoring in the *summary* module. Modules that create
widgets for the summary may look slightly different.
