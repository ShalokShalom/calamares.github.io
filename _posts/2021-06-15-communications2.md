title: "Communications Channels Again"
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

Calamares, like many Free Software projects, has been
using IRC for many years for real-time communication, for idle chit-chat and 
for community-building. We now **primarily** use [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) (`#calamares:kde.org`)
and **secondarily** the [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) IRC network (`#calamares`).
The Freenode channel that was the chatroom of the project from its
start in 2014 is no longer controlled, operated, or monitored by
the Calamares team.

For communications that **can wait**, like bug reports, issues,
feature requests, the best place remains [GitHub issues](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues).
This is where long-term discussions go, and where we can properly
keep track of whether they are fixed or not.

For **real time** communication, chit-chat, discussing whether something
is worth filing an issue for, notifications, and little things
(typo's, website stuff) there are:

- **primary** [Matrix via :kde.org](https://webchat.kde.org/#/room/%23calamares:kde.org) (link is to Element on KDE.org)
- **secondary** [IRC on Libera.chat](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.libera.chat/#calamares) (link is to Kiwi IRC connecting to Libera.chat)

IRC is not persistent, so don't ask-and-leave in the channel because you
will never get an answer. It does not require registration, though.
Matrix **is** persistent, but you will need to register **somewhere** on
the Matrix federation.

Matrix is preferred. It has persistence, rich text, and better notifications.
