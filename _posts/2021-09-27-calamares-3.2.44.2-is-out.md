Another day, another typo in Python modules. Several of them,
even, on code paths that apparently -- and fortunately -- nobody
is using. The release scripts now run *pylint* as part of
the release process to check for obvious problems. Those problems
should have been obvious -- with enough eyes on them anyway --
before, but now the machine does part of the looking for us.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Corey Lang (new contributor, welcome!)

This is a hotfix for a typo -- not a syntax error -- that affects the
*networkcfg* module. Reported and fixed by Corey. Also reported by
Shrinivas, and Joe, and others. Thanks to Anke for pointing out
[pylint](https://pylint.org/) as a useful tool for chasing down
-- and avoiding -- these problems in future.
