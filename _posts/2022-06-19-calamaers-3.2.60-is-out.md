---

This is the first community-maintainence release of Calamares 3.2.
Somewhat ironically, all the commits in the branch come from
Adriaan de Groot -- the community is working in the 3.3 (*calamares*)
branch.

> **NOTE** that as of this release announcement, there
> are known issues with the *locale* module which now misplaces
> English. Distributions are recommended to stick with 3.2.59,
> or solve issue #2008 first.

## Core ##
 - No core changes

## Modules ##
 - *fstab* now warns when the mount options are empty (which is non-
   sensical, and indicates that the configuration is bad).
 - *locale* does a better job of preserving Catalan (Valencia)
   across modules; previously it dropped the *Valencia*
   after the locale module unless you specifically re-selected
   `ca@valencia` in the locale module. (Reported by Lliurex)
 - *welcome* now has text labels on the special buttons (nominally,
   this is part of the core, but the *About* button was always on the
   welcome page).
