---

This release has remarkably little user-visible change in it,
**unless** you are looking for better translation coverage,
for instance when starting Calamares in Russian and switching to
Chinese. For your typing please, the *keyboardq* module (used
by KaOS) now offers keyboard layout previews.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Anke Boersma
 - Joe Kamprad

## Core ##
 - Translations have been made more consistent. In particular, some *OK*,
   *Yes*, *No* and *Cancel* buttons that were previously untranslated
   or "stuck" in the language that Calamares started in, are now
   changed to the current language as selected in the welcome page.
 - Documentation improvements from Joe Kamprad. A *sizeLimit* of zero
   (which is the default if nothing is set in the branding configuration)
   disables log uploads.

## Modules ##
 - The *keyboardq* module (QML-based UI for keyboard-layout-selection)
   now features an interactive keyboard preview and has the
   layout adjusted. (Thanks Anke)
