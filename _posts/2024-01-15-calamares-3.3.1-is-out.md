Somewhere Calamares 3.3.0 was released, but it did not get
a release announcement or a -- what it deserves -- series of
how-to-update posts for distributions. And here we are,
at the first patch release of the 3.3 series. It's been a
month, with the intention to do a release every other month, as needed.

This post is only about the changes in 3.3.1. Note, too, that there
is a *calamares-extensions* release to accompany this Calamares release.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Adriaan de Groot
 - Aleksey Samoilov
 - Emir Sari
 - Simon Quigley
