Calamares serves the needs of several dozen Linux distributions,
large and small, based on any one of the "big five" distro's, with
whatever desktop environment users would like. Two new faces
(both Arch-derivatives) have joined the club this month, so let's give them a bit
of spotlight.

## Archcraft

[Archcraft](https://archcraft-os.github.io/) describes itself as 

> Yet another minimal Linux distribution, based on Arch Linux.

No full desktop environment, "just" openbox and a bunch of tools to start
with. Archcraft launches a really nice "welcome" webpage at startup,
and they've done a nice job of doing introductions -- it's a nice live ISO to
use, and you can install it, too.

## XeroLinux

[XeroLinux](https://xerolinux.online/) is a little more personal-project, describing itself as

> a personal project I am working on that I thought I would share, in case 
> someone out there shares my passion for building Linux.

It's built through the ArcoLinux tooling and the site has lots
of little news updates and pointers to tools -- news and
tools that help to build the distro itself. It runs a heavily-customized
KDE Plasma desktop and like many Arch derivatives has an **amazing**
rainbow terminal experience when you open up konsole.
