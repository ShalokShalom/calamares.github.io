A little release with a handful of Qt6-related improvements, a bugfix for NetPlan, and a new feature in the *displaymanager* module.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Adriaan de Groot
 - Evan James

## Core ##
 - Calamares logs more information about how the executable was created
   in the session log on startup. This will help in recreating the specific
   configuration when bug reports are filed. (thanks Evan)
 - The debug window now has better Qt6 compatibility.

## Modules ##
 - *displaymanager* module can configure an alternate SDDM configuration file.
 - *networkcfg* a bug affecting NetPlan + NetworkManager was fixed.
