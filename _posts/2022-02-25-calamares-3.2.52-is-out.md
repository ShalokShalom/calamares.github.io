This is a regular short-cycle release.
There are a handful of bugfixes. There are a number of
things-to-watch-out-for (ask on the Matrix channel if needed):
- Distributions that use the *pacman*
  package manager and experience crashes during installation should
  comment out the progress callback in the *packages* module.
- Distributions with KDE Plasma 5.24 may need to disable automount
  in Plasma entirely.

## Core ##
 - No core changes

## Modules ##
 - *fstab* recognizes nvme and mmc devices correctly as SSDs now. #1883
 - *luksbootkeyfile* handles trailing slashes in mount point
 - *partition* can be built with a new `SKIP` option, which skips
   the actual formatting steps but does not fail. The old `LAME`
   option is renamed `BAIL_OUT`.
 - *users* has a new key *sudoersConfigureWithGroup* to allow for
   different styles of sudo configuration. #1887
