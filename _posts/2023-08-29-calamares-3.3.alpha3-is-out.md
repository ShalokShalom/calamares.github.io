## Core ##
 - Incompatible module-configuration changes, see #1438.
 - Branding entries use ${var} instead of @{var} for substitutions,
   in line with all the other substitution mechanisms used from C++
   core. See documentation in `branding.desc`.
 - Boost::Python requires at least version 1.72.
 - KDE Frameworks must be version 5.58 or later.
 - The `INSTALL_CONFIG` option has been removed. If you are installing
   the example configuration files from the Calamares repository, just
   stop. That was never a good idea, and you should keep your configs elsewhere.
   *NB: this is likely to be rolled back; although forking the repo
   to modify the configuration is a terrible idea, this also breaks
   patching-the-configurations at build- or packaging-time.*
 - Progress percentage during install can now be localized. (thanks Emir)

## Modules ##
 - *dracut* added a configurable kernel name. (thanks Anke)
 - *initcpiocfg* orders hookds slightly differently. (thanks Peter)
 - *localeq* moved to using Drawer instead of ComboBox in UI. (thanks Anke)
 - *keyboardq* moved to using Drawer instead of ComboBox in UI. (thanks Anke)
 - *netinstall* now has a new *noncheckable* option for groups, which prevent
   it a group from being checked/uncheckd as a whole. You can still check
   individual items **in** the group though. (thanks Shivanand)
 - *partition* can now pick LUKS or LUKS2. (thanks Jeremy)
 - *zfs* creates a hostid through zgenhostid.
 - *zfshostid* new module to copy zfs generated /etc/hostid
